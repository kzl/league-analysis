Datasets (.csv) should go in this folder. Make sure to save the
files as .csv with UTF-8 encoding.

The naming convention I have used for the scripts (but can be
changed as necessary) are:

From Chuck Ephron's Kaggle page (https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends/data):
- 2015_2017_complete.csv

From Oracle's Elixir (http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/):
- 2016_complete.csv
- 2017_complete.csv
- 2018_spring.csv
- 2018_summer.csv
- 2018_worlds.csv
- 2019_spring.csv
- 2019_summer.csv
